3.	Describe the purpose of each of the following folders in a Laravel project:
App: The "app" folder contains the core application code, including models, controllers, views, and other classes that define the business logic of your Laravel application.

Bootstrap: The "bootstrap" folder holds the essential files required to bootstrap the Laravel framework, including the autoloader and the configuration files needed to initialize the application.

Config: The "config" folder stores various configuration files for your Laravel application. It includes files to define database connections, cache settings, application-specific configurations, service providers, and more.

Database: The "database" folder is used to manage database-related files such as migrations, seeders, and factories. Migrations help you modify and manage the database schema, while seeders and factories assist in generating dummy data for testing or development purposes.

Public: The "public" folder is the web server's document root. It contains the entry point for your Laravel application (index.php) and any publicly accessible assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS files. Only the contents of this folder are directly accessible from the web.

Resources: The "resources" folder stores non-PHP resources for your application, such as views, language files, and raw assets like JavaScript and CSS files. The "views" subfolder contains Blade templates for generating the user interface.

Routes: The "routes" folder holds all the route definitions for your application. Routes define the URLs that map to specific controllers or closures, allowing you to handle HTTP requests and define the endpoints of your application.

Storage: The "storage" folder is used to store files generated by your application, such as logs, cached views, session data, and uploaded files. It has subdirectories for logs, cache, framework-specific storage, and other temporary files.

Tests: The "tests" folder contains automated tests for your application, including unit tests and feature tests. These tests help ensure that your application functions correctly and meets the desired specifications.

Vendor: The "vendor" folder holds all the third-party libraries and dependencies that your Laravel application relies on. It is automatically managed by Composer, the dependency management tool for PHP, and should not be modified directly.
